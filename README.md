## What is the hard way?
According to the author, the philosophy encourages learners to avoid shortcuts like copying and pasting. This helps reinforce the principles and get the learner used to the language.

## Why is this on my GitHub?
I do not intend for anyone to use this as a learning tool, please visit the author's site above or better yet, purchase the book. I am only posting the content because I want it as a reference for myself and as a way to validate skill level.
